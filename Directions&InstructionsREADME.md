The packaged that we used that weren't in the standard install were: 
  nltk and requests.

You can download nltk by:
-Navigate to the command prompt and typing/entering "pip install nltk"

You can downlaod requests by:
-Navigate to the command prompt and typing/entering "pip install requests"

After you installed both packages navigate to the the file path of of our repository and run "py main.py"

This will then prompt you to give an url from a recipe from allrecipes.com. Input the url and then hit enter. After that you will be prompted to input a number based on the recipe transformation you want to see (including just seeing the original recipe). Input your choice and press enter. Scroll up to see the components of the recipe and the transformations. You can hit '7' to choose/enter a different recipe. You will be continuously prompted to pick a transformation until you input the number ('8') to exit out.
